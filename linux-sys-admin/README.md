Linux System Administration

Hello, this dir of all of my Linux Sys Admin notes, lab experiments, visuals, etc.
I want to showcase everything I learn and how I apply it to real-world applications.
I'm very excited to keep learning and pursue a path in Systems Administration because being in charge of servers and user perms
is something that I'm not too unfamiliar with since I have my own personal homelab running Ubuntu.

These are my main objectives:
1. Being able to start and maintain a Linux server using the Ubuntu distro
2. Create, modify, and delete users, groups, perms, directories to understand how one change effects a user's experience when trying to access files within a system
3. Using LVM to create and modify disk partitions with their own file systems and understand how the LVC process happens in real time
4. Setting up network configurations such as: DNSs, DCHP, IP, Subnets, Broadcast
5. Being able to expose the server on the internet so I can have my peers join and mess around with the server
6. Breaking it and repairing the server

All this will be hosted on a VM using the Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS Live Server iso running locally on my UGreen NAS.
The VM is built with 20 GBs of total storage, running on UEFI bootloader, with LVM capabilities

This will be mounted on /dev/vda.

I'll do what I can, and what I can't do I'll try anyways.
